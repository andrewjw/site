This is the second part of my write up of the LeadDev London 2024 conference. To read my thoughts on
the talks from day 1, and my overall impression of the conference please read
[my previous post](/2024/06/27/leaddev-london-2024-day-1/). As with that post this is just the summary
of my notes, so will give you a flavour of the talks. This should help you decide if you want to pay for
a digital pass to access the videos, or if enough time has passed to look them up on YouTube or the
[LeadDev site](https://leaddev.com/).

In the afternoon I attend a workshop by a couple of Google engineers on [DORA](https://dora.dev/). I've
watched the recording of the talks I missed, so I've included my thoughts below. My write up of the workshop
is at the end of this post.

And with that out of the way, on with the talks...

## Build great engineering teams and have a positive social impact

_[Germán Bencci](https://twitter.com/gbencci) and [Seraphine Young](http://twitter.com/seraphine_young)_

This was a talk about the [Code Your Future](https://codeyourfuture.io/) charity. They do digital skills training
for refugees and disadvantaged people. There was no leadership takeaway from this talk, but one fact that I was
not aware of is that 1 in 78 people in the world is forcibly displaced. This is an awful lot higher than I would have
guessed.

While the talk was fine, and the charity is certainly worthy they didn't really have an "ask" at the end of the
talk. I would have been ok with them asking for donations, but they didn't do that, or talk about how you could get
involved. I left the talk feeling glad that a charity like this exists, but not with a sense of how I could help.

## Revolutionizing engineer growth: The tech-powered blueprint for careers clarity at ASOS

_[Gareth Waterhouse](https://twitter.com/gwaterhouse85) and [Ed Collins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-collins-46152122/)_

This talk was a case study about introducing a careers model as ASOS, the online clothing seller. It wasn't clear what
an engineer needed to do to get promoted, and they were getting low scores in employee satisfaction surveys. They also
knew they had to support "squiggly" careers, where people move back and forth between different crafts as their career
progresses.

They produced a set of conversation starters with versions for managers and engineers on how to approach career meetings, and what
questions to ask. They also produced documentation that covered "What does good look like?". It also included "How should \<role>
think and act?", and "What should \<role> do?". They also produced a website where you could use sliders to measure yourself
against different competencies, and then it produced a radar to highlight your strengths and weaknesses.

## Making smart investments: A framework for maximizing your ROI in technical decisions

_[Katerina Iliakopoulou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katerinailiakopoulou/)_

Everyone makes technical decisions. Some are big decisions, some are small - but everyone makes them. Even if you
want your team to make decisions, you have to give them guidance. Is how you define gain the same as your team or your
manager? Bias affects how you see gains, and overlook costs so try to be impartial.

Katerina then presented a model for how to make technical decisions

 * Potential. Try to use metrics to identify the gains.
 * Risks. Identify constraints and uncertainties. Do we have the money and resources for this project?
 * Involvement. Who needs to support the project? Get their buy-in.
 * Skills. Do you or your team have the right skills?
 * Motivation. How excited are the team?

Risks + Involvement + Skills = Cost

Potential + Motivation = Gain

## Iterate to greatness: Building high performance, AI-native engineering teams

_[Jared Palmer](https://x.com/jaredpalmer)_

This was a blatant pitch for [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which in itself is not a bad thing, but it was so overblown that it
just seemed like a puff-piece of AI hype. There was an interesting section in the middle of the talk about testing AI model and
using data to improve and guide the training. One of the key points seemed to be that Vercel made it incredibly quick to deploy,
on the order of seconds to deploy a new AI model. There was no talk about actually implementing functionality, it was just AI
can do everything for you. Avoid.

## Beyond the hype: Practical steps to establishing and scaling your data & ML team

_[Ellissa Verseput](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellissaverseput/)_

In age of AI dominating everything (see the previous talk!) this was a talk advocating for "traditional" machine learning
and data analytics to be forgotten. Ellissa works for a company that are trying to balance electrical grid supply and demand,
which is important with an increasing share of green sources. They do this by turning large industrial appliances on and off.

The value proposition was established using a spreadsheet, and then they gradually evolved their data strategy by automating
the many data requests Ellissa's team were getting.

## The Post Office Scandal: What we can learn from its process and human failures

_[Hywel Carver](https://twitter.com/h_carver)_

This talk was a summary of the [Horizon IT scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Post_Office_scandal), which caused
more than 900 subpostmasters to be wrongly convicted of theft or fraud due to problems with the IT system. This was an
excellent talk about the potential real-world dangers of an IT system. In 2000 it was decided that UK courts should assume that
computers were working as intended, the same as they do with traffic lights and speed cameras. Anyone who knows how many
bugs there are in computer software will find this terrifying...

The key message from this talk was that we should give our teams the right skills to do their jobs. We should listen to
users and teams, and not bury our heads in the sand about potential problems. We should also trust people over systems,
but verify to ensure our trust is well placed. And finally we should be humble about our software.

## The boss's shoes don't fit: And other surprises of leadership

_[Inna Weiner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inna-weiner/)_

This was a talk about the early stages of becoming a manager.

1. Speak less - you are likely not the most knowledgeable person in the room. Also, as a manager, your words will be
   amplified 10x.
   Listen more - if you avoid micromanagement you can become an absent manager, so be engaged and pay attention.
2. Speak more, but differently - explain the way you are thinking, and explain why something is important. Be curious.
   Diffuse the situation if necessary. You're in other meetings, so be generous with the knowledge this gives you.
   Connect the dots.
3. 5:1 ratio of positive to negative feedback. (There's a lot on this in other talks and books, but I'm not convinced
   it's a good thing to follow.)
4. Be a good story teller - accomplishments don't speak for themselves.
5. Celebrate! Credit is infinite.

## Uncertainty of change

_[Jitesh Gosai](https://twitter.com/JitGo)_

This talk is worth watching for the slides alone. They zoom and slide over the screen, connecting one screen to the next
in a very slick way. The talk started with some examples of people or companies who resisted change - the
[Luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) (who resisted textile machinery), Seers (who failed to adapt to online
shopping), Blockbuster (who had the chance to buy Netflixs and didn't), and Nokia (who were sold to Microsoft and still
failed to remain relevant).

Jitesh then moved on to talking about the psycology of change, and how people resist big change because it's hard to predict,
but small changes offer more certainty. They talked about our fight, flight, freeze and faun (i.e. submission) instincts, and
how we can't tell the difference between a change in a team's ways of working and a bear.

They then moved on to the difference between complex and complicated. Complex systems are unknowable due to emergent
behaviours, while complicated systems They described how modern software is complex, not complicated.
