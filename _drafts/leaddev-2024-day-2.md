This is the second part of my write up of the LeadDev London 2024 conference. To read my thoughts on
the talks from day 1, and my overall impression of the conference please read
[my previous post](/2024/06/27/leaddev-london-2024-day-1/). As with that post this is just the summary
of my notes, so will give you a flavour of the talks. This should help you decide if you want to pay for
a digital pass to access the videos, or if enough time has passed to look them up on YouTube or the
[LeadDev site](https://leaddev.com/).

In the afternoon I attend a workshop by a couple of Google engineers on [DORA](https://dora.dev/). I've
watched the recording of the talks I missed, so I've included my thoughts below. My write up of the workshop
is at the end of this post.

And with that out of the way, on with the talks...
