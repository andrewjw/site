It's June, so for the fourth time I was lucky enough to be able to head into London for the annual LeadDev
conference, this time updated and renamed to LDX3. LeadDev is increasingly popular, and had outgrown the
space at the Barbican so this year was held at the [Intercontinental at the O2](https://iclondon-theo2.com/).
Previous years had separated the LeadDev, Staff+ and Leading Eng tracks so if you had tickets to one
you couldn't go and see talks on a different track. This year it was one big conference, so apart from a
separate Director+ area anyone could see any of the talks.

As a space the Intercontinental worked ok. The Barbican is a unique venue with a lot of character so it's
difficult to replace that vibe. The Intercontinental was essentially a giant square hotel ballroom, surrounded
by scrub land (although with a pretty cool view of Canary Wharf). The LeadDev team had done a good job jazzing
up the space with lights and screens, but the stage even for the main Organisational Leadership track was small
compared to the Barbican, and I definitely missed the lovely comfortable Barbican raked seating with perfect
sightlines from wherever you chose to sit.

I've previously complained about the toilets at the Barbican, and those facilities were much better at the
Intercontinental. Clean, functional and didn't have to queue for long. However, food was a bit of step back.
With the different tracks breaking at slightly different times if your track finished later then in the morning
and afternoon breaks you were likely to find all the food already gone. On the first day there was no food in the
morning and in the afternoon I only found a sad looking pot of chilli nuts. On day two I happened to chose an early
breaking track, so I managed to grab a tasty cake.

Lunch was better in that there was generally plenty of food, although I did spend about 10 minutes queuing near a
pile of food because there were no plates available. Seating during lunch is always going to be difficult, and at
the Barbican I usually ate while sat on the stairs. The Intercontinental was no different. The desserts at lunch
were similar to the breaks, and if you arrived late you could well miss out.

The conference was split into three main stages: The largest Organisation Leadership stage, the medium sized
Technical Strategy stage, and the small Ways of Working stage. The LeadDev team underestimated the popularity of
the Ways of Working stage and on the first day quite a few people failed to get into the room as it was full.
Credit to LeadDev though, by day two they had magiced up a hundered or so headphones and chairs so you could watch
a live stream.

I appreciated the opportunity to pick and choose the talks that suited me best, so I did move around the stages over
the two days. I planned my days to stay at the same stage until a break, and only then move. Unfortunately a lot of
people switched stages after every talk, which was very disruptive and occasionally disrespectful to the speakers who
were on next. With the single track conference at the Barbican you didn't have a choice but to sit there and watch
whoever was on stage. If I were running the conference, next year I would advertise which talks were in each block,
but not give specific timings for them to encourage people to not pick and choose quite so much.

As usual there was a lot on apart from the main stages, including table talks, workshops, expert coaching and a networking
event. I took part in a workshop, which I'll write about in my round up of day 2, and the networking mixer, but didn't
take advantage of the rest of the sessions. Away from the talks the space very extremely busy and a bit overcrowded. It
was not easy to move around. The sponsor hall in particular was always packed.
