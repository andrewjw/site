This is a follow up my first post about [day 1](/2023/08/17/leadev-london-2023-day-1/) of the 
LeadDev London 2023 conference. That post covers my notes on talks from day 1, as well as my
thoughts on the overall conference.

Here are my notes on talks from day 2...

## Building bridges: The art of crafting seamless partnerships between engineering, product, and design

_[James Stanier](https://twitter.com/jstanier)_, _[Winter Wei](https://leaddev.com/community/winter-wei)_ and
_[Janet Balneaves](https://leaddev.com/community/janet-balneaves)_

This was an interesting style compared to the other talks at LeadDev. Instead of one or two people delivering
a prepared talk here we had three people (one from each disipline of engineering, product and design) having
a discussion. It worked pretty well, and they had clearly prepared so made some useful and interesting points.
As it wasn't a prepared presetnation it perhaps wasn't as impactful as the other talks, but it was definitely
a nice change of pace.

## Riding the rollercoaster of emotions

_[Gabriel Michels](https://leaddev.com/community/gabriel-michels)_

Some emotional events that can happen at work are:

* Breaking production
* Team member unexpectedly quits
* Users don't like a new feature
* Difficult co-worker

Start with yourself - handle your own emotions first. Recognise negative thoughts, keep calm and don't react
emotionally.

## Platform engineering is all about product

_[Gal Bashan](https://leaddev.com/community/gal-bashan)_

Dev and Ops -> Dev and DevOps -> Dev and SRE - rebranded teams, same problems.

The goal of platform teams is the enablement of developers.

Have a problem first mindset - ensure you are solving problems your developers are having. Developers know
what problems they are having - ask them!

Even with platform teams, agile is still valuable. Deliver incremental valud and get fast feedback.

## Cultural post mortems: an approach to learning and recovering when your people systems fail

_[Winna Bridgewater](https://twitter.com/thepreviewmode)_

Complex adaptive systems operate at the edge of chaos. We work in organisation complex systems, with...

* a shared goal
* varied interactions
* feedback loops
* emergent behaviour from teams operating as a system.

## Strategies for succeeding as a underrepresented engineering leader

_[Rafia Qutab Kilian](https://leaddev.com/community/rafia-qutab-kilian)_

Leadership is a learned skillset.

Assess a company like you would a neighbourhood.

Expand your network - sponsorship is more valuable than mentorship.

Be strategic!

## Feature flags unleashed

_[Roger Gros](https://leaddev.com/community/roger-gros)_

Flags should be part of a company culture, but they do create risks...

* breaking current behaviour
* operational complexity
* tech debt
* high initial investment

## Build a data-driven on-call workflow for your team with atomic habits

_[Bianca Costache](https://twitter.com/biiancacostache)_

Create a sense of shared accountability and empowerment.

Look at the mean number of interupted nights.

To improve the on-call experience tackle:

* Siloed knowledge
* Poor documentation
* Boring technical adversity (where all fixes lead to large problems)

Make sure alerting is connect to service level targets. You don't want to 
be alerted for issues that are not causing a problem.

To improve avoid the status quo bias - "would you like a shovel? But I'm already
using a spoon!"

Atomic habits:

* Make it obvious
* Make it attractive
* Make it easy
* Make it satisfying

Create space for reviewing on call.

## Keeping your team health after a layoff

_[Leandro César Silva](https://leaddev.com/community/leandro-cesar-silva)_

Prepare for the event:

* Plan what work will be dropped
* Prepare the communication
* Draw scenarios and team structures
* Take diversity into account
* Talk to direct leaders

Through the layoff
* Talk to impacted people immediatately
* Talk to the company as soon as possible
* Talk to teams as soon you can after you've talked to the company

Give people time to say goodby. Don't make another big change for a while.

Moving forward there will be...

* Fear - reinforce the company's next steps, and ensure people maintain a good work-life balance.
* Guilt - reinforce why the layoffs happened.

To help retain those who remain:

* Recognise good work
* Implement shared projects
* Prioritise opportunities internally
* Give people some time off
* Some people will need mentorship - be closer to them.

## Parents who code: How to welcome your developers back after parental leave

_[Sinéad Cummings](https://leaddev.com/community/sinead-cummings)_

Sleep bad = code bad - and as a new parent you are almost guarenteed to be sleeping bad.

People who were working while someone was on leave will have seen changes be introduced slowly. The
person who was on leave will see them introduced over night, when they return.

Try to limit the knowledge gap created by long leave through documentation. Keep a record of changes
for them to review when they return.

It is understandable to be resistant to change when you were not involved in the discussion. Try to
show the options you've considered.

Assume nothing about what matters to the returnee.

Use KIT (Keeping In Touch) days to spread information over the period of their leave.

Assign them a buddy who will advocate for them while they are on leave, and support them when they
return. This is optional, people might not want a buddy.
