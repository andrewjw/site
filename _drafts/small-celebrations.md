Software development can sometimes feel like an endless treadmill. Push that commit, review that code,
investigate and solve that bug. Rinse and repeat, day after day.

You probably have some high-level business and technical aims that you're working towards. This might
be releasing a large new feature, or perhaps migrating to a new infrastructure or a new software stack.
These long-term projects might take a year or more to complete, and can often feel never-ending.

If you're working on a mature code base it can be hard to see the progress that you've made. One of
your jobs as a leader is to help the team step back and see how far they've come. One way to maintain
motivation in a team is to celebrate achievements and show the wider business the progress that has
been made.

It can be hard to know how to celebrate, and how often. Too frequently and you'll be celebrating things
that are too small and simple, and it will seem forced. If you wait for the large projects to finish then
you could be waiting for a very long time, and it will feel like you never celebrate anything.

I'm not saying never celebrate the small stuff, and never celebrate the big projects. If someone has
completed a particularly gnarly ticket, then it's worth shouting about. Take the team out for a meal if
you've successfully launched a big new feature. However, it's the in-between celebrations that are key to
maintaining motivation in a team.

There are two audiences for a celebration - internal and external, and both can have motivational benefits.

By celebrating internally you can help people to feel recognised by their peers, to step back and see the
progress they've made and help people to realise that those large, long-term goals, which may seem
unattainable, are actually achievable.

Internal celebrations don't need to be big or fancy. Even a short Slack post calling out some good work to
a wider audience will be appreciated. If you have monthly or quarterly town halls, for a small group of teams
then these can also be a good venue to call out a successful piece of work.

External celebrations might take the form of a town hall to a wide audience, an email newsletter or a global
Slack post. The aim will be to raise awareness of the work your teams have been doing, to a group of people
who might not be aware of the details. A side effect is to show people that their work is valued by the wider
business and to show that you as a leader are acting as a cheerleader for your teams.
