Recently I was lucky enough to attend Lead Dev London for a second time (see my review of 2022 
(day 1)[/2022/06/17/leadev-london-2022-day-1/] and (day 2)[/2022/07/29/leadev-london-2022-day-2/]).
As with last year this is a one track conference focused on leadership and engineering management.
Unlike last year LeadDev were also running a separate one track conference at the same time, StaffPlus,
focused on Staff+ engineers. As I didn't have a ticket to that, I didn't attend of those talks but it
was great see LeadDev expanding and I'll definitely be considering StaffPlus next year.

The event took place at the same location, the Barbican in central London. The auditorium is a lovely
space, with excellent sight lines from everywhere and good acoustics. The spaces outside are pretty
tired looking, and in particularly the toilets were terrible. For a 1000+ person conference this
definitely took the shine of attending. The food provided was good, and the logistics of the lunch rush
were handled well. This year the networking mixer was held downstairs in the sponser's hall, where are
last year it was upstairs in the breakout space. I felt the sponser stalls got in the way rather, and
prevented people from mixing. I think the addition of something to help people mix would help break
people out of their company groups - whether it's a kind of speed dating system, or something a bit more
low key, just handing people a beer and leaving them to it doesn't really work.

On stage things were generally slick, with (Meri Williams)[https://twitter.com/Geek_Manager] compereing
again. The conference definitely suffered from technical issues, with clickers repeatedly not working,
a few microphone issues and some issues with videos playing without sound. Some issues are understandable,
but it was a bit disappointing they hadn't been ironed out by day two.

Compared to last year the conference has added a number of activities in the gaps between conference
sessions. These included live coaching, table talks and AMAs with LeadDev staff. I only tried attending
a table talk, and it was too noisy to properly engage in, which was a real shame. To help navigate all
the activities two new "experience hosts" were added ((Jessie Belle)[https://twitter.com/_jessie_belle]
and (Amber Shand)[https://twitter.com/amberleetech], who were presenters last year). They added a great
feeling of energy to proceedings, but having three people on stage at the end of each session of talks
was a bit slow, and most people just want to get up and stretch their legs. Hopefully LeadDev will find
a better way to promote the extra activityies. Even just having Meri at the start and Jessie and/or Amber
and the end of each session would have made things run more smoothly.

Those a minor niggles though, and I hope to be attending again next year. Anyway onto my summary of some
of the talks.
