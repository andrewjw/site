Recently I was lucky enough to attend Lead Dev London for a second time (see my review of 2022 
[day 1](/2022/06/17/leadev-london-2022-day-1/) and [day 2](/2022/07/29/leadev-london-2022-day-2/)).
As with last year this is a one track conference focused on leadership and engineering management.
Unlike last year LeadDev were also running a separate one track conference at the same time, StaffPlus,
focused on Staff+ engineers. As I didn't have a ticket to that, I didn't attend of those talks but it
was great see LeadDev expanding and I'll definitely be considering StaffPlus next year.

The event took place at the same location, the Barbican in central London. The auditorium is a lovely
space, with excellent sight lines from everywhere and good acoustics. The spaces outside are pretty
tired looking, and in particularly the toilets were terrible. For a 1000+ person conference this
definitely took the shine of attending. The food provided was good, and the logistics of the lunch rush
were handled well. This year the networking mixer was held downstairs in the sponser's hall, where are
last year it was upstairs in the breakout space. I felt the sponser stalls got in the way rather, and
prevented people from mixing. I think the addition of something to help people mix would help break
people out of their company groups - whether it's a kind of speed dating system, or something a bit more
low key, just handing people a beer and leaving them to it doesn't really work.

On stage things were generally slick, with [Meri Williams](https://twitter.com/Geek_Manager) compereing
again. The conference definitely suffered from technical issues, with clickers repeatedly not working,
a few microphone issues and some issues with videos playing without sound. Some issues are understandable,
but it was a bit disappointing they hadn't been ironed out by day two.

Compared to last year the conference has added a number of activities in the gaps between conference
sessions. These included live coaching, table talks and AMAs with LeadDev staff. I only tried attending
a table talk, and it was too noisy to properly engage in, which was a real shame. To help navigate all
the activities two new "experience hosts" were added ([Jessie Belle](https://twitter.com/_jessie_belle)
and [Amber Shand](https://twitter.com/amberleetech), who were presenters last year). They added a great
feeling of energy to proceedings, but having three people on stage at the end of each session of talks
was a bit slow, and most people just want to get up and stretch their legs. Hopefully LeadDev will find
a better way to promote the extra activityies. Even just having Meri at the start and Jessie and/or Amber
and the end of each session would have made things run more smoothly.

Those a minor niggles though, and I hope to be attending again next year. Anyway onto my summary of some
of the talks.

## Managing at the threshold: Examining our principles in a moment of change

_[David Yee](https://twitter.com/tangentialism)_

In 2002 Google removed engineering managers, and switched to a much flatter org structure. This lasted
for a few months, and a few years later in 2009 Google published
[Project Oxygen](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/the-evolution-of-project-oxygen/) which describes
what they had learned about engineering management.

For years it was accepted that that most senior engineer in the room would be your manager, but engineering
management in a skill in its own right. 

After COVID-19 there was a period of change known as "The Great Resignation", which was people taking controls
of their careers.

A Liminal Space is a space between states. It space where we change. If you are in a Liminal Space nobody
is going to tell you want to do. If you don't have a process you can trust, you have principles you can follow.
Stay true to those.

## Compassionate on-call

### Flexibility
You shouldn't have to stop to go on call.

### Autonomy
Anyone on call has to be able to fix their own pain.

### Support
Anyone on call must have support they can use.

### Pager Load
The foundation of sustainable on call.

## Red 2.0: Transforming a game company

_Colin Walder_

This was a talk about the process of changing a games company after the disasterous launch
of Cyberpunk 2077, which was riddled with bugs and poorly received, even after the team
had worked a significant amount of crunch time on it.

Unfortunately, this was a pretty bad talk. There was some talk of how the teams were restructured,
but not in enouch detail to be useful to others. There was some talk about how they adopted agile
processes, but this was not a talk about agile, so lacked details - and how many people other than
games companies are not already using agile?

This talk might have been interesting if it was after the release of the Cyberpunk expansions that
is coming later this year, so they could compare the development process and reception to both, but
since it's not been released yet there is not much to compare yet.


## What do you mean thereâ€™s no onboarding plan for engineering managers?

_[Daniel Korn](https://twitter.com/korndaniel1)_

Starting a new position is hard, and starting as an engineering manager is doubley hard because as a
manager you will have people immediately looking to you for guidance, inspiration and support, despite
being new to the company. 

The key factors for a good on-boarding plan are creating a sense of belong, and deliverying a sense of
accomplishment. It should prepare people for their new role, and connec them to the culture.

Things that should not be part of the plan are making technical contributions, and making big changes.

New employees should own their own on-boarding, so they are in charge of the pace and content.
