---
Last week I was lucky enough to spend a couple of days at the [LeadDev](http://leaddev.com) London
2022 conference. This is a series of conferences aimed at senior engineers and engineering
managers, although for obvious reasons it's been a few years since it was last held.

The conference itself was held in the
[Barbican Hall](https://www.barbican.org.uk/hire/venue-hire/barbican-hall), which in general is a
lovely venue. The seats in the hall were comfortable, and spending two days sitting there was not
as unpleasant as I had feared. The Barbican itself was built in the early 1980s, and a few areas,
in particular, looked like they needed some refurbishment - particularly the downstairs men's
toilets.

The food was very nice, particularly the [Banoffee pie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banoffee_pie)
from lunch on day two. The size of portions was generally good, although you did need to stock up
from the salad bars at lunch to get a decent plate full. Queues were also not too much of a problem,
other than the first ten minutes or so of lunch.

Enough about the practicalities though, what about the content? No one goes to a conference for the
food, but instead for what you can learn and take back to your job. LeadDev is a single-track
conference, so you have no choice over what to see, but fortunately, most of the content was general
enough to be useful to everyone. Both days were hosted by
(Meri Williams)[http://blog.geekmanager.co.uk/] who did a great job keeping things moving swiftly,
and setting the scene for each talk.

The one talk I did skip was about scaling a mobile app deployment process because I don't work in
mobile. There was another talk with a brilliant title about driving and defining software quality,
which turned out to just be a story of someone's time in game development QA, and I struggled to
find any useful takeaways. These scheduling missteps were rare though, so now lets talk about the
talks I enjoyed the most.

As I write this you can buy on-demand access to all the talks from the
[LeadDev site](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london/digital-access-passes). I don't know if they
plan to make the talks available for free at somepoint, but
[previous conferences are available](https://leaddev.com/events/leaddev-london-2019), so that
suggests they will be.

The following is a summary of my notes from each talk. Any mistakes, errors or things that don't
make sense are entirely my fault. Hopefully this will provide a flavour of each talk and inspire
you to watch the ones that interest you the most to get the full story.

## Navigating The Chaos of Scaling
_[Vitor Reis](https://leaddev.com/community/vitor-reis)_

This talk was about how tell what a high performing team look likes, but also about how to make the
trade offs to make high performance sustainable.

What does chaos look like? It can look like managing 20 people and still being on the on call rota
(depressingly this applies to me!) or doing five or more interviews a week because there aren't
enough people available to do interviews.

Try to recognise when you're doing poor work, or are wrong by being self aware. Also ask your manager
what they think it would great looks like in your position, and compare it to your current performance.

Your aim is to be replacable. If there's a process you run can you automate it? Can you delegate it?

Be efficient with your time, and take the time to reflect on how you've spent your time each week, Try
to do better each week!

It's tempting to add people to a team but this can have negative consquences. People start to wonder if
they're being replaced. They worry that the new person might not do their job well, or that they might
do it better than them! Adding people will make things go slower, at least for a while.

As a leader you should be writing all the time. Writing is thinking, and it helps others to follow your
thought process.

## Keeping Your Code Base Fun At Scale
_[Raul Chedrese](https://twitter.com/raulchedrese)_

This was a short talk looking at the question of how we ensure every developer has a fun experience?
Code bases naturally become less fun to work on as they get bigger.

Don't assume you know the answer - try to understand the developer experience, then form a vision and
iterate on it. Understanding can be as simple as sending a survey with the question "What is preventing
you from having a fun experience?"

Focus on building strong tools. Pick one thing and focus on that, rather than trying to solve too many
things at once.

## CSS: Cascading Support Systems
_[Phil Bennett](https://twitter.com/phil_bennett)_

Empathy in senior leadership is a superpower. It increases creativity and productivity. When you are several
levels up it's easy to burn out worrying about the problems of all the people who report into you.

A technique that Phil has borrowed from theraphy is
[Solutions Focused Brief Theraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution-focused_brief_therapy). This
work similar to how we work in product and engineering teams, so is familiar to people. To follow it
you ask the question "Imagine the problem you're facing as gone away. What do you notice?" Work with them
to define the steps to get there, and help them to execute those steps.

As a senior leader you should ask people to support each other, and cascade this to the people who report
to your reports. You can scale empathy!

## What Dashboards Don't Tell You
_[Laura Tacho](http://lauratacho.com/)_

As someone who is passionate about dashboards and trying to be data driven in management, this was my
favourite talk of the conference.

Some metrics can be perceived differently. Laura used the example of peaks and troughs in tickets
completed metric. Without additional context different people can interpret the data differently.
By overlaying the number of incidents the metrics becomes more more valuable.

People's self perception matters more than we think, and we should not discount qualitive metrics.

How do you move from metrics being perceived as survallance rather than empowerment?

Vanity metrics are metrics without meaning. We can add tension to metrics to make them more
valuable. Balance speed or activity against quality, reliability or satisfcation.

Laura recommended three sources that I have not yet checked out, but I intend to.

* [The SPACE of Developer Productivity](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124)
* [Mind the Gap: On the Relationship Between Automatically Measured and Self-Reported Productivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07428)
* [How to Misuse and Abuse DORA Metrics](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=883791)

She also recommended [GetDX.com](https://getdx.com/) as a tool to help you measure developer
experience. Unfortunately it has a truly terrible website, with no information about the tool,
or any hint of pricing, just a "request a demo" button. I really liked the sound of this tool,
but it's going to be hard to for me to justify investing time in it.

# Building The Perfect Asynchronous Meeting
_[Alexandra Sunderland](https://twitter.com/alexandras_dev)

How is an asynchronous different from Slack thread or an email? It's still scheduled like a meeting,
but instead you just put deadlines into people's calendars about when they should have responded to
the meeting. It requires all the usual good practices for meetings, but they're even more important.
You should share timelines for the meeting, expections about what people should do, logistics of how
to contribute (Google Docs, Miro, etc), and what you expect from people.

Meetings don't need to be 100% async, but the preparation can be done before a shorter synchronous
catch up. For a retro you could fill in the retro board ahead of time, and then have a meeting to
discuss the board.

This that can be asynchronous are information pushing or brainstorming. Relationship building should
be synchronous.

The benefits are that you get more time for thought, the context is more accessible (although more
effort is required to set the agenda and keeping notes). The downsides are that it requires more
coordination, and you don't get real time answers or fast paced discussion.

This was a really interesting idea, and I intend to try it out for the next retrospective I run.

# Skiller Whale Coding Competition

During the conference [Skiller Whale](http://skillerwhale.com) were running a coding competition
where the top three entries would win an Oculus Quest 2. The challenge was two fold. Firstly you
needed to write an SQL query processing some customer data. The second part was to automate the
submission so you could submit it quickly enough.

The first part was pretty fiddly to get right. There was a customer table, and an orders table. The
problem was to calculate the average rank of customers over a period, where customers are ranked
daily based on the amount spend, including on days when they didn't spend anything. Ranking customers
is easy enough using the [rank function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-window.html).
The challenge comes from including customers on days they didn't order anything. This requires a `full
outer join` between a table of dates and the customers, and then left joining onto the orders table.

Each time you submitted an entry you were given a different date range and target rank to return. The
second part of the challenge is to automate the submission so you can submit in less than one second.
Luckily for me only two people completed this part, leaving the third spot open to the person with the
most efficient query. I managed to sneak into third place by replacing the date table, which initially
I was doing by running a distinct over the dates in the order table (requiring a full scan of the table),
with the [`generate_series` function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-srf.html) which
is much more efficent.

I'll write a review of the Quest 2 after it arrives, thanks Skiller Whale!

I've included the SQL I submitted below, just in case anyone is interested.

{% highlight sql %}
with sales_by_day as
    (select dates.date, customers.id as customer_id, name,
            rank () over
                (partition by dates.date
                    order by coalesce(sum(amount), 0) desc)
                as pos
        from customers
             full outer join
                (select @start_date
                        + (n || ' day')::interval as date
                    from generate_series(0, 30) n) as dates
                on 1=1
             left join orders on
                orders.date >= @start_date
                and orders.date <= @end_date
                and orders.date=dates.date
                and orders.customer_id=customers.id
        group by dates.date, customers.id, name)
select name, avg_pos from (
    select name, avg(pos) as avg_pos,
           rank () over (order by avg(pos) asc) as avg_rank
        from sales_by_day group by customer_id, name
) as avg_rank
    where avg_rank=@rank limit 1
{% endhighlight %}
