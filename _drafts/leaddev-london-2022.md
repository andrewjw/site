Last week I was lucky enough to spend a couple of days at the [LeadDev](http://leaddev.com) London
2022 conference. This is a series of conferences aimed at senior engineers and engineering
managers, although for obvious reasons it's been a few years since it was last held.

The conference itself was held in the
[Barbican Hall](https://www.barbican.org.uk/hire/venue-hire/barbican-hall), which in general is a
lovely venue. The seats in the hall were comfortable, and spending two days sitting there was not
as unpleasant as I had feared. The Barbican itself was built in the early 1980s, and a few areas,
in particular, looked like they needed some refurbishment - particularly the downstairs men's
toilets.

The food was very nice, particularly the [Banoffee pie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banoffee_pie)
from lunch on day two. The size of portions was generally good, although you did need to stock up
from the salad bars at lunch to get a decent plate full. Queues were also not too much of a problem,
other than the first ten minutes or so of lunch.

Enough about the practicalities though, what about the content? No one goes to a conference for the
food, but instead for what you can learn and take back to your job. LeadDev is a single-track
conference, so you have no choice over what to see, but fortunately, most of the content was general
enough to be useful to everyone. The one talk I did skip was about scaling a mobile app deployment
process because I don't work in mobile. There was another talk with a brilliant title about
driving and defining software quality, which turned out to just be a story of someone's time in game
development QA, and I struggled to find any useful takeaways.
