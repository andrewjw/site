The concept of a minimum viable product (popularised by Eric Reis in The Lean Start-Up *CONFIRM*) is pretty much
ubiquitous in modern software development. But what does minimum look like for software that interacts with the
physical world? If your software manages a physical process, such as a production line or factory or warehouse
process, then it's very likely that minimum means all features are implemented, and the physical process operates
with a desired efficiency level.

How can you test your software while the physical aspects are being built? And how do you know that the physical
design is optimal? The answer is to simulate as much possible, as early as possible.
