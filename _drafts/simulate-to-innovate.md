The concept of a minimum viable product (popularised by Eric Reis in The Lean Start-Up *CONFIRM*) is pretty much
ubiquitous in modern software development. But what does minimum look like for software that interacts with the
physical world? If your software manages a physical process, such as a production line or a warehouse
process, then it's very likely that minimum means all features are implemented, and the physical process operates
with a desired efficiency level.

How can you test your software while the physical aspects are being built? And how do you know that the physical
design is optimal? The answer is to simulate as much as possible, as early as possible.

A simulation can be anything from a simple spreadsheet formula, to a 3d visualisation with realistic
moving parts to show the expected physical behaviours. How much effort you should put into the simulation depends
on what stage of the project you're at, and how impactful being wrong would be. At a project conceptualisation stage,
you can probably afford to have a rough calculation that gives you numbers in the right ballpark. The closer you
get to confirming the physical design, beyond which point changes become exponentially more expensive, the more
detail you need. Lastly, as your physical build progresses, and your software development continues your simulation
should have increasingly more fidelity to give your software developers an accurate testing environment to give you
confidence that the software and hardware will work together as intended, from the moment you go live.
