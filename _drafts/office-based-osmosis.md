title: Office Based Osmosis
---
Recently my collegue Chris Sheldon [posted an article](https://medium.com/@chris.sheldon/under-pressure-3d64147e110e) titled
"[Under Pressure](https://medium.com/@chris.sheldon/under-pressure-3d64147e110e)". It's excellent so please take a few minutes
to have a read of it.

Ok, are you back? Great. Chris talks in part about feeling like he misses absorbing knowledge through osmosis in an office.

Osmosis, in case you've forgotten your biology lessons, is the spontaneous passage of something through a semipermeable
membrane. In this case, we're talking about knowledge entering your head without you needing to consciously do anything
about it.

Working from home can indeed be an isolating time. In my experience, short term productivity
and intra-team relationships are (in general) not affected by working from home. The biggest impact is on inter-team
relationships and a lot of that is down to the osmotic acquisition of knowledge that Chris was talking about.

Back in the distant past (e.g. 2019) when you were sat near another team you would overhear discussions about what
they were working on. Whether consciously or not, this would lead to you instinctively knowing when there was overlap, or
when there were opportunities for collaboration. It would also lead to a feeling of working for a larger group than
just your team, and this would result in a closer connection to those in other teams.

If you miss out on this knowledge then it can result in duplicated work or conflicting solutions to the same problem.

So, what can you do to improve things?

If you aren't going to acquire knowledge spontaneously, then you need to be more intentional about both obtaining and
sharing knowledge. The key point here is that you be more deliberate about acquiring knowledge, but it's also important
to be deliberate about sharing knowledge so others can benefit too.

In the office, you might have a network of people that you bump into and then go for coffee or a lunch. These conversations
are goldmines of unintentional knowledge transfer. When working remote, whether that's full time or even part-time, these
networks take more effort to maintain and build, but it's effort that's well worth spending.

Schedule regular catch ups with people, just half an hour is plenty of time to keep the relationship alive and gain a
nugget of useful information. As well as catching up with people you already know, ask them explicitly who else they
think you should talk to? You're not going to bump into people randomly in a Zoom call, so be more intentional about
expanding your network.
