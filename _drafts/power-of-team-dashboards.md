title: The Power Of Team Dashboards
---
Using metrics and dashboards is a well understood tool when monitoring the health and performance
of software, or your profitability or other key business metrics. What is less common is using
the same tools and techniques to monitor the health and performance of the team behind the
software. I'm not suggesting using dashboards to report on individual developers, but as a tool
to help the team focus on improving their own processes it can be useful tool, if handled
carefully.

My own journey started when I was promoted from team leader to engineering manager, responsible
for five teams. The change in level resulted in a significantly different view, but also great
difficutly in knowing where to focus my efforts. When you're a team leader you are so close to
the team that you hear and feel every change in mood, and have intimate knowledge of all projects
and their current state. Suddenly being responsible for five teams gives a great view to take
advantage of areas of collaboration between teams, and removes you from the noise of day to day
life so you can focus on the biggest issues. However, it also removes you from the firehose of
raw information so it can be hard to know where you should spent your time to get the best return
on your energy.

The solution to this problem is the same as it would be for a software system you want to improve,
measure everything! Error rates, latency, memory usage, throughput - measuring software has a
long history, but measuring a team is much tricker.
