Recently one of my team asked me how they were doing, and to be fair I think they've been doing
great. The challenge though is that they started as team leader right about the time that
COVID-19 hit. Working for online supermarket, particularly around March was certainly challenging,
but in someways it actually made things easier. When there is a fire to put out, it's easy to know
what to do next - you put the fire out! And after that? You put the next fire out!

Certainly there are challenges for being a team leader during a crisis. Perhaps people in your team
are stressed or losing their cool. You might have stakeholders shouting at you to fix things quicker.
Maybe you have to take shortcuts that you know lead to technical debt, but that will get things
fixed quicker.

Calming people down, and protecting your team are important skills for a team leader. Knowing when
to make pramatic technical decisions is something all developers should know. And recognising then
your stakeholders are crying wolf and you can push back on fixing their fire is important. For us,
back in March, it was pretty clear that this was real crisis and we needed to do all we can to help.

Things have moved on since then, and although the world is still suffering, from the perspective of
us writing software to help keep people fed things are pretty normal. The challenge for my new team
leader starts now.
