DevOps as a concept has been around since around 2010, but implementing the ideas behind it,
particularly when you're in a team that is supporting old monolithic codebases. For several years
we had engineers fulfilling the role of "DevOps Engineer". Having a specific person working on
DevOps is a bit antithetical to the DevOps concept - it's supposed to be a state of mind and a set
of practices rather than a job role.

The aim was always to have that engineer act as a source of expert knowledge and an enabler. Teams
were still supposed to own their code, processes and deployments, but in reality, DevOps related
work was often thrown over the wall to that engineer with the expectation that they were their
problem, and not the team's problem.
