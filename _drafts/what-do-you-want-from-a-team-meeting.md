Most teams will have a team meeting on a regular schedule. Once a week,
every two weeks or once a month the team gets together to discuss the
day's big issues. This can be a difficult meeting because it doesn't have
a defined agenda, and is open-ended.

Other meetings either drive a project forward, solve a
specific problem or implement a specific process. They might have a
varying agenda, but the overall goal of the meeting is (hopefully) clear,
and there is a point when the meetings will stop. Barring the team disbanding,
this is not true for team meetings.

A common pattern, and one I am certainly guilty of, is asking people
what issues they would like to discuss, and perhaps sharing a few updates
from around the business. When you get to the end of the agenda you just say
"Thanks everyone" and go back to your desks.

The problem with this is that you are encouraging people to just bring
existing problems to the table, and then only if you manage to get the culture
to be non-threatening enough that they feel comfortable with sharing their
issues with the group.

What if you were able to get the team to work together on topics before they
become a problem? To build relationships that foster collaboration outside the
regular meeting, and allow people to be more proactive rather than reactive.

In the book Time To Think by Nancy Kline she talks about creating a "Thinking
Environment". Now, this book has quite a few problems (to put it quite mildly)
and I'm not a fan of it, but the core idea is sound - by giving people the space,
time and attention to think clearly they will reward you with insights that may
lead to a step change in their, and your team's, performance.

So how do you do that? First, open your meeting with a positive "icebreaker".
Just asking people to share one positive thing that happened to them in the
last week, and letting everyone speak in turn will set the mood of the meeting,
and show that everyone's contributions are welcomed.

Once everyone has had a turn to speak, move on to the agenda. At this point, you
need to decide what you want out of the meeting this week. It could be that there
is an urgent problem that needs a decision; in that case, you should
steer the group towards making it. However, often while there are topics to discuss,
the conversation is more about the strategy the team wants to take while tackling
a project or problem that is being worked on. 

While discussing strategy getting as many views as possible is key. No idea should be
unheard, and while you do eventually need to agree as a team on the desired approach,
at the beginning of the discussion the more inputs there are the better.

As a leader, it's easy to feel that problems that are most acute in or only affect, your
teams should be dealt with by you. In fact, building a leadership team who share problems
and collaborates on solutions benefits everyone, and can only happen if people share. ** we want people to bring future issues **

Team meetings between individual contributors and those between a team of leaders have a
different focus. When it is ICs collaborating the team should be focused on the same domain.
While they might have different foci or skills, the challenges they face and the goals they
are working towards will be similar. For a team of leaders this is not necessarily true,
and the differences between the areas represented in the meeting can mean there is little
overlap in the challenges being faced.
