Most teams will have a team meeting on a regular schedule. Once a week,
every two weeks or once a month the team gets together to discuss the
day's big issues. This can be a difficult meeting because it doesn't have
a defined agenda, and is open-ended.

Other meetings either drive a project forward, solve a
specific problem or implement a specific process. They might have a
varying agenda, but the overall goal of the meeting is (hopefully) clear,
and there is a point when the meetings will stop. Barring the team disbanding,
this is not true for team meetings.

A common pattern, and one I am certainly guilty of, is to just ask people 
what issues they would like to discuss, and perhaps share a few updates
from around the business. When you get to the end of the agenda you just say
"Thanks everyone" and go back to your desks.

The problem with this is that you are encouraging people to just bring
existing problems to the table, and then only if you manage to get the culture
to be non-threatening enough that they feel comfortable with sharing their
issues with the group.
