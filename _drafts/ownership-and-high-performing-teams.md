title: Ownership and High Performing Teams
---
Imagine you're making a change to code base you don't like. Testing is difficult and don't have a
good understanding of how all the parts of the system fit together. It's tempting to just do a bit
of cursory testing, deploy it to production and keep your fingers crossed. This is not a pleasant
situation to be in, and will inevitably lead to production incidents, sad developers and cross
managers.

As a manager if you encounter a situation like this you've got a choice to make about how to fix it.
Instincively you might want to put more processes in place around deployment and testing. Maybe kick
off a project to refactor the code base and make testing easier.

The underlying problem is that the team feels disconnected from their software. They might own it
according to your org chart, but they don't feel ownership of it. This lack of ownership can
manifest itself in many ways, but principly it results in a "good enough" attitude and a lack of
interest in the negative effects that a deployment might cause.
