title: Leadership Stand-Ups
---
Standups are standard practice among developers, but when you move into the realm of leadership
they stop. If you're a team leader then you will probably join your team's stand up meeting, but
often you only contribute a brief update, if anything at all. Mostly you just listen and perhaps
facilitate discussion on other people's updates.

In [Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni](https://amzn.to/3k5qrUC) (affiliate link included)
the CEO in the story asks her executives to consider that group as their primary team. I've been asked
to do the same too, but really, if you only meet once a week or perhaps even less frequently, how can you
do that? If a group is your primary team then you should know (at a high level) what everyone is
working on, and what their main problems are. A leadership team where you only discuss what people decide
to bring to the table will not function as well as a group that can benefit from collective wisdom being
brought to bear on problems.

When you start a leadership position your calendar suddenly fills up with meetings, so the idea of adding
a daily meeting might seem crazy, and it probably is. But leadership is a different role to a developer, and 
you can use different processes to achieve the same goals.

As a developer, simplifying greatly, you might work on one ticket, then move on to the next, all working towards
completing a small number of projects. Leadership positions usually involve much longer running pieces of work,
with many more running in parallel. I typically might touch on four or five of my current agenda items, progressing
each one a little bit each time. There's not much use in giving a daily update, a weekly cadence shows a 
better view of my progress.

As a leadership team you probably already have a weekly meeting, so why not spend the first 15 minutes of that
doing a stand-up? You could, but it's probably quite an expensive 15 minutes, and a rushed, or not well thought
out update is probably not much use to the team.

With remote working now being much more common the tools for asynchronous communication are much more widely available.
Whether it's an email, a slack post or something else a weekly post that's shared with others will have benefits
for yourself, and your leadership team.

For the last two and a bit years I've been posting a weekly update on Slack
