**tap, tap, tap** Hello, is things on?

I started this blog way back in 2008 and was fairly active through to 2012. Unfortunately, apart from a period in 2017 it
has been dormant since then. Working for a hedge fund, who are notoriously secretative, and having children, who are
notoriously good at sucking up all your free time, meant that blogging really wasn't an option. Now I work for a
more open company ([Ocado Technology](https://www.ocadogroup.com/about-us/ocado-technology)) and my kids are a little
older, so require a bit less time, I'm hoping to resurrect my blog.

Originally I created the blog on [Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com), which worked great. It was free, reliable and easy
to use. Unfortunately when I started writing a new post the editor had become unusable for me. Perhaps I'm an old
fuddy-duddy, but I just want to be able to write my text, add some simple pictures and have the editor get out of my way.
Sadly, it quickly became clear that Wordpress was going to get in my way, so it was time to give the blog a new home and a
new lick of paint.

For many years I've had a [Linode server](https://www.linode.com/?r=24724540c4f4e6c4e633d405ed0e807e2df58005), which I use
to host a few small websites. I've always been a fan of Markdown, so a static site generated by [Jekyll](
https://jekyllrb.com/) seemed like the obvious choice.

Of course, the only way to start a new project is to buy a domain name. After trying some variations on my name I
discovered that [theandrewwilkinson.com](https://www.theandrewwilkinson.com) so I snapped it up. I don't think I
can claim to be **the** Andrew Wilkinson. I'm not even the most successful Andrew Wilkinson in tech, that has to be
[this Andrew Wilkinson](https://twitter.com/awilkinson). However, it beats a wordpress.com address, so it'll do.

Jekyll was suprisingly easy to get started with. I was a bit worried as a bit of Ruby-phobe, but even for someone who
doesn't know anything about Ruby it was easy to get started. Getting my old posts out of Wordpress was straight forward,
and they were easily converted into Markdown. I spent quite a bit of time tidying up the generated Markdown, fixing broken
links and images, etc, but fairly quickly my new blog was full of my old content.

One advantage of Wordpress is that you can hit the big `Publish` button and your post is live on your site. Fortunately,
in the 12 years since I started this blog many things have come along to make automating publishing a static site easier.
Obviously the first step was to set up a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andrewjw/site). I have had good success 
with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) in the past, and it worked well here too. They provide a prebuilt Ruby image,
which includes `rsync`. Running the Jekyll builder and then `rsync`ing the generated content over to my Linode server on
success was really quite simple to get running.

So far everything had gone a lot more smoothly than I'd expected. Converting my old posts to tidy Markdown had taken longer
than expected, but it was more labourious than difficult. The final thing I wanted to tackle before going live was 
comments.
