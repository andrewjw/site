In what is fast becoming an annual tradition I recently switched on my Slack out-of-office, packed up a
bag with plenty of room left for some conference swag, and got on the train to the Barbican for
[LeadDev London 2024](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london) (see my review of 2022
[day 1](/2022/06/17/leadev-london-2022-day-1/) and [day 2](/2022/07/29/leadev-london-2022-day-2/), and
2023
[day 1](/2023/08/17/leadev-london-2023-day-1/) and [day 2](/2023/09/21/leadev-london-2023-day-2/)).
As with last year, this is a one-track conference focused on leadership and engineering management, with a
separate one-track conference at the same time, StaffPlus, focused on Staff+ engineers. I only have a ticket
to LeadDev, so only got to see those talks.

As in previous years the event was held at the Barbican in central London. The main event space remains excellent,
with good acoustics and sightlines for all 1000+ attendees. Last year I complained about the state of the toilets,
and while the existing toilets are still there and haven't been renovated there was a temporary set of additional
toilets which were much better. The quality and speed of the food remains excellent, although I was a bit short-changed
at lunch on the second so had to have a second dessert to ensure I had enough energy for the final set of talks.

There were an expanded set of activities during all the breaks, but these were very popular and terrible acoustics meant
it was challenging to get close enough to even hear what was happening, let alone contribute. This fact was acknowledged by
the host [Meri Williams](https://leaddev.com/community/meri-williams) at the end of the conference, where the bombshell news
that will be leaving the Barbican after nine years was dropped. The venue for next year will be the
[InterContinental at the O2](https://iclondon-theo2.com/). Hopefully, this will solve the acoustic issues with the activities
and they will have better toilets. Apparently the move is to allow the conference to expand, so fingers crossed it keeps
the lovely sense of community and doesn't become a faceless megaconf (e.g. QCon). Time will tell, and even though the new location
nearly doubles the commute time for me it's highly likely I'll be attending again.

One addition to the schedule compared to last year was a set of three "micro workshops", which ran for 80 minutes at the same time
as one block of talks. With three workshops, each running twice, there was plenty of opportunity to find a workshop that interested you
and didn't clash with talks you were keen on. As I attended the talk on the second day I'll cover the workshop in the second part of this
write-up.

In general, the quality of the talks was excellent, and even the first-time speakers did a great job of hiding their nerves and putting
on a polished presentation despite speaking to over 1,000 people. I'm secretly glad that my talk was not among the 24 selected from
700+ proposals as I'd likely turn into an unintelligible pile of jelly if I had to walk on that stage, so kudos to everyone who presented.
As usual, there was a good range of topics that are likely to be relevant to a wide range of leaders, and they mostly avoided sales pitches,
with the notable exception of the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) talk on day 2 which I felt badly misjudged the room. It was also interesting
that there was a lot of scepticism of Generative AI both on stage and in the audience, apart from a couple of talks (one of which was the Vercel
talk). It's good to see the LeadDev is not getting carried away on the Gen-AI hype train.

What follows is a summary of my notes from each talk. I believe you can buy digital passes to catch up on the talks, or they are usually put
onto YouTube after a few months.

## Embracing engineeringâ€™s place at the forefront of business

_[Renee Hunt](https://leaddev.com/community/renee-hunt)_

This was an interesting talk by the CTO at [Compare The Market](https://www.comparethemarket.com/) about the overlap between technology
and business. Half the executive team at CTM come from a tech background. Being a technology leader is morphing into business leadership,
a tech person can learn about business, but you can't give a business person 20 years of experience in technology.

She described how the number one priority for the business was a migration to [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). This is obviously a very
technology focused project, but all the executives (including non-technical execs, like the CFO) were on-board with it being the top
priority for the business because a good story had been told about why it was good for the business, and the future changes it would allow.

She closed with a message that people should prepare to lead, but even as a technologist, that role might not be direct in tech.

## How do you deliver a feature on the biggest stage in the world?

_[Josh McNamee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshmcnamee/)_

This was a bit of an odd talk for LeadDev. It focused on the technology needed to display video at the [Las Vegas Sphere](https://www.thesphere.com/),
which is a giant dome with the world's largest video screen. It's certainly interesting technology, and it looks cool - but the talk was pitched halfway
between a tech demo, and a talk about the organisation that helped it happen. As a result, it didn't really succeed at either.

## Engineering leadership in 2024 and beyond: Skating where the puck is going when the ice is melting

_[Lena Reinhard](https://twitter.com/lrnrd) and [Scott Carey](https://twitter.com/scarey102)_

In this session the results of [The LeadDev Engineering Leadership Report 2024](https://leaddev.com/engineering-leadership-report-2024)
were discussed. The tech landscape has been complicated over the last few years, with waves of layoffs. Apparently, 7% of companies had
both layoffs and hiring increases in the last year, and 71% of engineering leaders have seen the scope of their work increase. The main
takeaway was that leaders should be "skating the where the puck is going, not where it has been". The landscapre is changing so fast,
being left behind is a real concern.

## Tech debt as innovation, reframing this forever problem as an opportunity

_[Bruce Wang](https://twitter.com/batmany13)_

This was a great talk from a really engaging speaker. Tech debt is a natural byproduct of the software development lifecycle, but tech
debt has a marketing problem. Tech debt doesn't come from no-where - systems that we are advocating now will become tech debt. 

Bruce defined tech debt as the delta between a system's current state and it's ideal state. *Add more here*

His recommendations for dealing with it include...

* be specific - what debt exactly are we talking about?
* Make the debt visible, perhaps through metrics or reports that show where the debt is.
* Be proactive - neglect is not a strategy.

Leaders change. Teams change. Business priorities change and technologies change.

Lies that people tell themselves about tech debt include:

* Legacy code == debt *Check this*
* Having debt zero as a goal.
* Debt reduction work is only for junior folks, or as part of on-boarding.
* There's nothing we can do.

Manage debt so we can say yes to the business more.

## From overload to oasis: Creating more time for the cool stuff

_[Dominika Pietrzak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominika-pietrzak-183755137/?originalSubdomain=uk)_

Cool stuff is relative, and changes over time. Your boring is someone else's cool. Share work that you consider
to not be cool to create space what you do consider to be cool, and because your boring is someone's cool.

## Managing across timezones; A retrospective

_[Matt Boyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattjamesboyle/?originalSubdomain=uk)_

I found this talk decidedly "meh". Timezones can be a real pain to manage across, but it's not a particularly complicated issue.

The main points from this talk were:

* Block out "golden hours" - when everyone is online. You won't always use the slot, but you want it available in case you do need it.
* Experiment with your processes.
* Use async processes as much as possible - wikis, blogs, ADRs, messages in public channels.
* Embrace timezones, and use them to reduce out of hours on call

## Building for the new developer

_[Cat Hicks](https://leaddev.com/community/cat-hicks)_

This was a very academic talk, with a much more rigorous evidence base than usual. Unfortunately I found it bit unclear and unfocused,
and I think it tried to cover too much given the timeslot for the talk.

When we join a new company we look for signals about what success means in that organisation.

A learning culture drives up productivity.

## Demystifying neurodiversity in tech with nostalgic video games

_[Parul Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theadhdtechrecruiter/)_

This talk had amazing slides with a classic video game vibe. Unfortunately the video game didn't seem to apply to anything other than
the slides, which felt like a bit of a missed opportunity.

They said that 53% of people technology are neurodivergent, but only 3% are disclosed. To help people work better small accommodations
make the world of difference. And don't be afraid to make suggestions - neurotypical people can make good suggestions too.

Try to take advantage of people with a different point of view, and a different way of thinking - dissent opens the mind. Be care though,
because unresolved conflict leads to a disengaged team and lower productivity.

Only 1 in 4 people is diagnosed as a child, so they are often learning what works best for them. Some people produce a "user guide" or a
"working with me manual" which describes how they like to work and helps to avoid conflict.

## How to use technology radars to make transparent tech decisions

_[Andra Blaj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrablaj/)_

Most people question a technology choice when tey join a company.

To create tech radar:

* Get leadership buy-in.
* Document all technology choices, including retroactively.
* Use human-centered design to make the radar easier to use.
  * one for contributors
  * one for implementors *check what this meant*
 
You should use the tech radar to question established technology choices.

Building a tech radar is easy, but building a culture of documenting decisions is hard. It takes time to embed that in a the culture.
