In what is fast becoming an annual tradition I recently switched on my Slack out-of-office, packed up a
bag with plenty of room left for some conference swag, and got on the train to the Barbican for
[LeadDev London 2024](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london) (see my review of 2022
[day 1](/2022/06/17/leadev-london-2022-day-1/) and [day 2](/2022/07/29/leadev-london-2022-day-2/), and
2023
[day 1](/2023/08/17/leadev-london-2023-day-1/) and [day 2](/2023/09/21/leadev-london-2023-day-2/)).
As with last year, this is a one-track conference focused on leadership and engineering management, with a
separate one-track conference at the same time, StaffPlus, focused on Staff+ engineers. I only have a ticket
to LeadDev, so only got to see those talks.

As in previous years the event was held at the Barbican in central London. The main event space remains excellent,
with good acoustics and sightlines for all 1000+ attendees. Last year I complained about the state of the toilets,
and while the existing toilets are still there and haven't been renovated there was a temporary set of additional
toilets which were much better. The quality and speed of the food remains excellent, although I was a bit short-changed
at lunch on the second so had to have a second dessert to ensure I had enough energy for the final set of talks.

There were an expanded set of activities during all the breaks, but these were very popular and terrible acoustics meant
it was challenging to get close enough to even hear what was happening, let alone contribute. This fact was acknowledged by
the host [Meri Williams](https://leaddev.com/community/meri-williams) at the end of the conference, where the bombshell news
that will be leaving the Barbican after nine years was dropped. The venue for next year will be the
[InterContinental at the O2](https://iclondon-theo2.com/). Hopefully, this will solve the acoustic issues with the activities
and they will have better toilets. Apparently the move is to allow the conference to expand, so fingers crossed it keeps
the lovely sense of community and doesn't become a faceless megaconf (e.g. QCon). Time will tell, and even though the new location
nearly doubles the commute time for me it's highly likely I'll be attending again.

One addition to the schedule compared to last year was a set of three "micro workshops", which ran for 80 minutes at the same time
as one block of talks. With three workshops, each running twice, there was plenty of opportunity to find a workshop that interested you
and didn't clash with talks you were keen on. As I attended the talk on the second day I'll cover the workshop in the second part of this
write-up.

In general, the quality of the talks was excellent, and even the first-time speakers did a great job of hiding their nerves and putting
on a polished presentation despite speaking to over 1,000 people. I'm secretly glad that my talk was not among the 24 selected from
700+ proposals as I'd likely turn into an unintelligible pile of jelly if I had to walk on that stage, so kudos to everyone who presented.
As usual, there was a good range of topics that are likely to be relevant to a wide range of leaders, and they mostly avoided sales pitches,
with the notable exception of the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) talk on day 2 which I felt badly misjudged the room. It was also interesting
that there was a lot of scepticism of Generative AI both on stage and in the audience, apart from a couple of talks (one of which was the Vercel
talk). It's good to see the LeadDev is not getting carried away on the Gen-AI hype train.

What follows is a summary of my notes from each talk. I believe you can buy digital passes to catch up on the talks, or they are usually put
onto YouTube after a few months.
