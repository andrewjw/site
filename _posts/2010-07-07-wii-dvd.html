<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/czechr/3051213042/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3051213042_8e189077ce_m.jpg" alt="DVD by czechr" style="float:right;border:0;" /></a>This weekend I brought <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> for the Wii. I greatly enjoyed the first one, and it's one of the few games that me and my girlfriend can play together.</p>
<p>It's a pretty easy game to pick up, but for this one Nintendo included a tutorial DVD. Two questions immediately spring to mind here. Firstly, what can you do with a DVD that you can't do with an in-game, interactive, tutorial. Secondly, why is this a DVD that you can't play on the Wii?</p>
<p>Let me just say that again.</p>
<p><b>Why is this a DVD that you can't play on the Wii?</b></p>
<p>To watch the tutorial you need to turn off your Wii, turn on your DVD player, watch the DVD, and then go back to your Wii. I'd love to know how Nintendo came to this decision, because it drastically slow you down your first experience of playing the game, and those that are mostly likely to want to watch the video are those who will struggle to switch over to the DVD player.</p>
<p>Come on Nintendo, you can do better than this.</p>
