Toby Segaran's book is given the subtitle "Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications". It's clearly been assigned to the book by a marketing drone who felt that they needed to get the phrase "Web 2.0" in there somewhere. Unfortunately this left me feeling a bit disappointed when read this book because it's not really what the book is about. A far better subtitle would have been "An Introduction to Machine Learning", but I don't work in marketing.

My expectation based on the title was that the book would focus mainly on how to generate recommendations based on a user interactions with a set of objects. I was expecting it to cover not only the mathematical basis for such algorithms but also the practical implications that sites like <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">Amazon</a> have to deal with processing such enormous data sets. While the book does cover recommendation systems they've given only a small slice of what is already quite a short book. There is no mention of how to process huge datasets either through map/reduce or some other scalable architecture.

The rest of the book is take up with classifying objects in a set, predicting the prices of a new objects given similar objects or filtering items such as email into spam and ham. These are staples of machine learning textbooks, but here are introduced in a very accessible and easy to read way. These chapters are interesting and informative but perhaps not that useful if you're building a web 2.0 site.

This is a great addition to the O'Reilly stable of programming book, it's just a shame they tried to shoehorn Web 2.0 in when that really gives the wrong impression of the book.
