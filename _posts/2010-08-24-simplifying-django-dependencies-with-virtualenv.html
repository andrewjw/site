As the name suggests, <tt>virtualenv</tt> creates a virtual environment which makes it easy to install Python packages without needing root privileges to do so.</p>
<p>To use the packages installed in a virtual environment you run the <tt>activate</tt> script in the <tt>bin</tt> directory of the virtual environment. This is fine when you're working on the command line, but you don't want to have to remember this step when running the debug server, and it's hard to get that to work when the site is deployed under <tt>mod_wsgi</tt>.</p>
<p>To make things easier you can add the appropriate directory from the virtual environment to Python's path as part of <tt>manage.py</tt>, or the appropriate <tt>fcgi</tt> or <tt>wsgi</tt> control script.</p>
<p>[code]<br />
import os<br />
import sys<br />
import site</p>
<p>root_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..'))</p>
<p>site.addsitedir(os.path.join(root_dir, 've/lib/python%i.%i/site-packages' % (sys.version_info[0], sys.version_info[1])))<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Just add the code above to the top of your <tt>manage.py</tt> file and the <tt>ve</tt> virtual environment will always be activated when you run the script.</p>
