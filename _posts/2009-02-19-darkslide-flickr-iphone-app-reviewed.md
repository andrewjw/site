[Darkslide](http://connectedflow.com/darkslide/) is an excellent iPhone app which makes it easy to use
[Flickr](http://flickr.com) on the move. The iPhone is a perfect partner for Flickr. Constant internet
access, GPS and serviceable camera mean that you can snap away and have your photos on the internet and geotagged
in seconds.

Flickr does have a [mobile site](http://m.flickr.com) and provides it user with an email address where you can
email photos. On an out of the box iPhone it's possible to get a decent Flickr experience. Emailing your photos has several
disadvantages: the quality is reduced, and the photo is stripped of geotag information.

Darkslide lets you easily take and upload photos at full resolution. You can also tag, comment and browse through both your
photos and others. You can also access the Flickr's interesting feed if you're in need of inspiration. It's available both
with and without ads, but apart from that the two versions are identical.

It's simple, slick and just works. If you're a Flickr user with a iPhone then it's a must have.
