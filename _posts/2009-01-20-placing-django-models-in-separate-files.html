<p><a href="http://blog.amber.org/">Chris Petrilli</a> has made a very useful post on <a href="http://blog.amber.org/2009/01/19/moving-django-models-into-their-own-module/">placing Django models into separate files</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing I do when starting a Django project is to delete the standard views.py file and replace it with a directory. It won't take you long before you've written enough views that a single file becomes huge. The same is true of models.py. If you have ten or more models then the file can quickly become a thousand line behemoth. I'd tried to split the file into a directory before, but it never worked, and the error messages were never helpful.</p>
<p>The solution is simple, you add a Meta class to your model with an app_label parameter.</p>
<pre>
from django.db import models

class Test(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = 'myapp'

</pre>
<p>So, thanks Chris!</p>
