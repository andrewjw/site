Recently I was lucky enough to attend Lead Dev London for a second time (see my review of 2022
[day 1](/2022/06/17/leadev-london-2022-day-1/) and [day 2](/2022/07/29/leadev-london-2022-day-2/)).
As with last year, this is a one-track conference focused on leadership and engineering management.
Unlike last year LeadDev was also running a separate one-track conference at the same time, StaffPlus,
focused on Staff+ engineers. As I didn't have a ticket to that, I didn't attend any of those talks but it
was great to see LeadDev expanding and I'll be considering StaffPlus next year.

The event took place at the same location, the Barbican in central London. The auditorium is a lovely
space, with excellent sight lines from everywhere and good acoustics. The spaces outside are pretty
tired looking, and in particular, the toilets were terrible. For a 1000+ person conference, this
took the shine off attending. The food provided was good, and the logistics of the lunch rush
were handled well. This year the networking mixer was held downstairs in the sponsor's hall, whereas
last year it was upstairs in the breakout space. I felt the sponsor stalls got in the way rather, and
prevented people from mixing. I think the addition of something to help people mix would help break
people out of their company groups - whether it's a kind of speed dating system or something a bit more
low-key, just handing people a beer and leaving them to it doesn't work.

On stage, things were generally slick, with [Meri Williams](https://twitter.com/Geek_Manager) MCing
again. The conference suffered from a few technical issues, with clickers repeatedly not working,
a few microphone issues and some issues with videos playing without sound. Some issues are understandable,
but it was a bit disappointing that they hadn't been ironed out by day two.

Compared to last year the conference has added several activities in the gaps between conference
sessions. These included live coaching, table talks and AMAs with LeadDev staff. I only tried attending
a table talk, and it was too noisy to properly engage in, which was a real shame. To help navigate all
the activities two new "experience hosts" were added ([Jessie Belle](https://twitter.com/_jessie_belle)
and [Amber Shand](https://twitter.com/amberleetech), who were presenters last year). They added a great
feeling of energy to the proceedings, but having three people on stage at the end of each session of talks
was a bit slow, and most people just want to get up and stretch their legs. Hopefully, LeadDev will find
a better way to promote the extra activities. Even just having Meri at the start and Jessie and/or Amber
and the end of each session would have made things run more smoothly.

Those a minor niggles though, and I hope to be attending again next year. Anyway, onto my summary of some
of the talks. LeadDev will put the videos online at some point, but as I write this they are only available
to people with tickets.

## Managing at the threshold: Examining our principles in a moment of change

_[David Yee](https://twitter.com/tangentialism)_

In 2002 Google removed engineering managers and switched to a much flatter org structure. This lasted
for a few months, and a few years later in 2009 Google published
[Project Oxygen](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/the-evolution-of-project-oxygen/) which describes
what they had learned about engineering management.

For years it was accepted that the most senior engineer in the room would be your manager, but engineering
management is a skill in its own right.

After COVID-19 there was a period of change known as "The Great Resignation", which was people taking control
of their careers.

A Liminal Space is a space between states. It is space where we change. If you are in a Liminal Space nobody
is going to tell you want to do. If you don't have a process you can trust, you have principles you can follow.
Stay true to those.

* Notice
* Think
* Persuade
* Proceed

## Compassionate on-call

_[Lisa Karlin Curtis](https://twitter.com/tangentialism)_

### Flexibility

You shouldn't have to stop to go on call.

### Autonomy

Anyone on call has to be able to fix their own pain.

### Support

Anyone on call must have support they can use.

### Pager Load

The foundation of sustainable on-call.

## Red 2.0: Transforming a game company

_Colin Walder_

This was a talk about the process of changing a games company after the disastrous launch
of Cyberpunk 2077, which was riddled with bugs and poorly received, even after the team
had worked a significant amount of crunch time on it.

Unfortunately, this was a pretty bad talk. There was some talk of how the teams were restructured,
but not in enough detail to be useful to others. There was some talk about how they adopted agile
processes, but this was not a talk about agile, so lacked details - and how many people other than
games companies are not already using agile?

This talk might have been interesting if it was after the release of the Cyberpunk expansions that
is coming later this year, so they could compare the development process and reception to both, but
since it's not been released yet there is not much to compare yet.

## What do you mean there’s no onboarding plan for engineering managers?

_[Daniel Korn](https://twitter.com/korndaniel1)_

Starting a new position is hard, and starting as an engineering manager is doubly hard because as a
manager you will have people immediately looking to you for guidance, inspiration and support, despite
being new to the company.

The key factors for a good onboarding plan are creating a sense of belonging, and delivering a sense of
accomplishment. It should prepare people for their new role, and connect them to the culture.

Things that should not be part of the plan are making technical contributions, and making big changes.

New employees should own their own onboarding, so they are in charge of the pace and content.

## Code is poetry

_[Niranjan Uma Shankar](https://leaddev.com/community/niranjan-uma-shankar)_

Maintaining a clean code base can have a huge impact on team performance. It will help you to:

* find bugs early
* add features quicker

Try to encourage strategic programming over tactical programming. Schedule time for spike sessions before
you tackle a big project, because the first idea might not be the best. Recognise strategic programming
with rewards.

All code should look like one person wrote it, so normalise nit-picking - but be kind!

## Why onboarding to a company's legacy codebase sucks, and how to make it work for your team

_[Shanea Leven](https://leaddev.com/community/shanea-leven)_

When onboarding you need to learn a number of things...

About the code/system:

* how does it fit together?
* what are the domain objects?

About working with the code:

* deployment procedures
* how to test

But you need to remember that people are human! Memory retention is an issue, and it's hard to learn new things.

Treat every code review as a mini onboarding to that part of the code. Start small, and expand the scope strategically.
Choose tasks that will build confidence in the codebase - tasks that require learning a small number of new things.

Tech debt reduction can be a good first task. Upgrades need little knowledge.

Learn about the frameworks used, as well as the implementation.

## Making the move to manager: Common pitfalls for new engineering leaders

_[Jacqueline Pan](https://leaddev.com/community/jacqueline-pan)_ and _[Marlena Lui](https://leaddev.com/community/marlena-lui)_

It's ok to say "I'd don't know" - be yourself!

Know where your time is best spent, and at what level you need to know the details.

## "I'm happy where I am" - Supporting team members that aren't seeking progression

_[Ryan MacGillivray](https://twitter.com/RyanMacG)_

There is a myth of constant promotion.

> The practice of an art isn't to make a living, it's to make your soul grow
>
> -- Kurt Vonnegut

Recognise cycles of ambition in your reports, and try to support them when they are
ambitious and when they aren't. Try to create a sense of development - grow in their
role, not just move up.

Don't deprioritise these people.

## How to drive pace in your team

_[Alicia Collymore](https://leaddev.com/community/alicia-collymore)_

Pace is value delivered at speed.

Set some defaults:

* what are you willing to compromise on?
* what are you not willing to risk?

Give lots of room for autonomy, and be transparent by default.

Create some hype! Get people excited about the value they will bring. Keep projects very short,
and keep them simple - use tried and tested technology. Aim to do the hard bits first, and remember
that work done is more important than work started.

Be laser-focused on value. We're not here for fun, we're here to make money!

Aim to beat deadlines - where can you get the best value for the time left
over?

Pain is expected, and that's ok - but try to give people on-call a break!

There are risks with being this focused on value:

* too much pressure
* poor code quality (so aim to make active tradeoffs)
* unhealthy competition
  * not everyone is fast in the same way

## How we support making architectural decisions

_[Olena Sovyn](https://twitter.com/frontendgirl)_

This was a description of their current process for making architectural decisions. They have
seven members of Technical Design Architecture Advisors. They have different domain knowledge, and
they rotate members regularly. They aim to be advisors, not gatekeepers.

[This article from Stack Overflow was recommended](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/06/a-practical-guide-to-writing-technical-specs/)
as it describes how to write a technical design document, and gives a good structure to start with.

Once a change has been proposed they spend 3-4 days gathering further details, and 3-4 days discussing them in the group
before making a decision. The possible outcomes are:

* Sponsored - they approve this change.
* Needs update - the proposal needs more work.
* Not recommended - they aren't gatekeepers, so can't say no, but they suggest not to do this change.
* Review not needed - this is an area they don't cover.
* Escalated - for some reason, this needs to be looked at by senior management.

## Where we’re going wrong with developer productivity

_[Cat Hicks](https://leaddev.com/community/cat-hicks)_

* Productivity is the stuff that is hard.
* Productivity is never stopping.
* Productivity is lonely.
  * we need to work together!

* Brittle productivity.
  * productive if nothing goes wrong.

vs

* Resilliant productivity
  * when something goes wrong, it delivers.

Thriving means:

* Agency
* Learning Culture
* Motivation & Self Efficacy
* Support & Belonging

Good managers blame processes not people.

Good productivity is adaptive and sustainable.

## Engineering A More Equitable Hiring Process

_[Jason Wodicka](https://github.com/jwodicka)_

Equity = treated differently to enable the same outcome.

Tolerance = You are allowed to be here.

Inclusion = We want you to be here.

Avoid pedigree bias - where they went to school or worked.

Decouple assessments - clarity of speech and explanation vs
just communication.

## How to effectively "Spike" a complex technical project

_[Aditya Bansal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adbansal/)_

First, understand the problem, then understand the technical landscape.

Don't...

* write clean code
* solve for everything
* take all the time in the world

After the spike...

* what's new?
* what's being modified?
* what do we need to discuss?

"Those with knowledge don't predict. Those who predict don't have knowledge."

## The 9.1 magnitude meltdown at Fukushima

_[Nickolas Means](https://twitter.com/nmeans)_

Nickolas gave the closing talk to day one of LeadDev last year, and this talk was
equally excellent. It's impossible to take notes for, but do watch it if you can
find it online.
