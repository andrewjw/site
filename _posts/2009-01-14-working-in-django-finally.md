For the past day and a half I have been building a website in Django rather than the C++ that is the bulk of my day job.
It's so easy, it makes me sad that I have to go back to C++ this afternoon.

I've also discovered that aggregation, the main feature I want from django,
 href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/t/2167b4b877027317?hl=en">will be committed to trunk tomorrow. Hurrah!
