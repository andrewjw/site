<p>Today is <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>'s <a href="http://code.flickr.com/blog/2009/02/10/birthday-kitten-tuesday/">fifth birthday</a>. I've had a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/andrew_j_w">Flickr account</a> for several years, and I use the site all the time. For sharing photos, finding photos to use on a website, or just to browse around it's really unmatched.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday Flickr!</p>
