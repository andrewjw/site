<a href="http://www.idsoftware.com">ID Software</a> have taken time out from letting you play Quake 3 in your browser to release a port of the granddaddy of all first person shooters - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D">Wolfenstein 3d</a>. The iPhone is really beginning to show itself as an excellent gaming platform, and despite its age Wolfenstein really looks at home on the phone.n
The graphics are, quite frankly, rubbish. However, they're exactly as they were when the game was released in 1992 which is exactly the point. The sound has faired much better and sounds great. The voices of the German soldiers still send shivers up your spine. It's an extremely faithful port of the game, and the addition of an automatic save feature means it really works as a pick up and play game. It's very easy to dip in and out of taking one level at a time.n
The controls have naturally been revamped for the iPhone's unique control system. You steer by moving your left finger over up/down/left/right arrows and fire by tapping your right finger on a button. This works really well and it is very easy to pick up and to start running around the Nazi prison that you find yourself in. The controls do rather feel like driving a fork lift truck. You regularly find your self reversing backwards around a corner, which is not how a person would move, but it's easy to forgive and hard to see how else it could be done.n
The game might seem a little expensive at Â£2.99 but you get all six episodes of the game which will last you many hours. It's available in the App Store now, and for such an old game still shows its class amongst the other games available on the iPhone.n
If you're interesting in the process of making the port then John Carmack has written a <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/wolfenstein3dclassic/wolfdevelopment.htm">detailed post describing it</a>.n
