<p>Technology is finally catching up with the principle of a digital photo frame and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-DPF-D70-Black-Digital-Photo/dp/B0013K533U/">this Sony DPF-D70</a> is really good example. The screen is fantastic, really clear and bright which shows off your photos well. Getting your photos on is a snap. Simply plug in your camera's card and click "Add to Album". It features 256MB which can hold a lot photos at the frame's one megapixel resolution.</p>
<p>The frame comes with a range of options. You can change how long the photos stay on the screen for, how they appear. You can display single photos, three photos at a time or clock or calendar view. It also features a handy timer function so you don't need to worry about it using power all night.</p>
<p>On the downside the frame must be plugged into the mains as there is no battery option. Also Sony have skimped on the packing as despite having a mini USB connector no cable is included in the pack. Come on Sony, can't you stretch to a simple cable?</p>
<p>Disappointingly the firmware seems to have few bugs. The menu system gives you the option to rotate a photo but when you turn the frame off the photo returns to its original orientation. This leaves that feature feeling a bit pointless.</p>
<p>If you want a largish frame with a great screen then this Sony should definitely be on your list of possibilities.</p>
