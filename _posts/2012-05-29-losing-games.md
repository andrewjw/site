I'm not a quick game player. I don't rush out a buy the latest games and complete them on the same weekend.
Currently I'm most of the way through both
[Alan Wake](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0037W6M28/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=indiegicouk-21
&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B0037W6M28) and [L.A. Noire](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/
product/B003NSBMBW/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=indiegicouk-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634
&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B003NSBMBW).

Alan Wake is a survival horror game where you're fighting off hordes of people possessed by darkness. L.A.
Noire is a detective story that has you solving crimes in 1940s Los Angeles. Both feature an over the shoulder
third person camera, and both have excellent graphics. They also both have a film like quality to the story.
In Alan Wake the action is divided up in six tv style "episodes", with a title sequence between each one. It
also has a number of cut scenes and narration by the title character sprinkled throughout the game which help
to drive the story forward.

{% include image.html image=1 %}In L.A. Noire you are detective try to solve crimes and rise up the ranks of
the police force. The game features cut scenes to introduce and close each case. During each case you head
from location to location and interviewing suspects and witnesses. The big breakthrough in L.A. Noire is the
facial animation in the game. Rather than being animated by hand the faces of characters were recorded
directly from actor's faces. This gives the faces a lifelike quality that has not been seen in games before.

Despite the extensive similarities between the game my opinion of the two could hardly be more different. Alan
Wake is one of the best games I've ever played, while L.A. Noire is really quite boring. I was trying to work
out why I felt so differently about them when I read the following quote in
[Making Isometric Social Real-Time Games with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/

The need for the face of characters in L. A. Noire to be recorded from real actors limits one of the best
things about games: their dynamic nature. Even if you get every question wrong you still solve the case and
make progress. Initially you don't really notice this, but quickly I found it meant that the questioning, the
key game mechanic, became superfluous.

Alan Wake is a fairly standard game in that there's really only one way to progress. This is well disguised
though so you don't notice. The atmosphere in the game forces you to keep moving and the story progresses at
quite a pace.

Ultimately it's not for me to criticise what games people want to play. FarmVille and the rest of Zynga's
games are enormously popular. What disappoints me most about L.A. Noire is that it's such a technically
advanced game, but falls down on such a simple piece of game mechanics. Alan Wake on the other hand succeeds
mostly based on story and atmosphere, and that's the way it should be.
