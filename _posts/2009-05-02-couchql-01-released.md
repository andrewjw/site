I've just uploaded the first release of CouchQL. It can be installed from PyPI by typing "easy_install couchql" or you can download a tarball from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/couchql/downloads/list">Google Code</a>.

It's a very early release, but please play with it, break it and email me your results!
