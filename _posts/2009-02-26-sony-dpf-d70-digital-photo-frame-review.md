Technology is finally catching up with the principle of a digital photo
frame and [this Sony DPF-D70](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-DPF-D70-Black-Digital-Photo/dp/B0013K533U/)
is really good example. The screen is fantastic, really clear and bright
which shows off your photos well. Getting your photos on is a snap.
Simply plug in your camera's card and click "Add to Album". It features
256MB which can hold a lot photos at the frame's one megapixel resolution.

The frame comes with a range of options. You can change how long the photos
stay on the screen for, how they appear. You can display single photos, three
photos at a time or clock or calendar view. It also features a handy timer
function so you don't need to worry about it using power all night.

On the downside the frame must be plugged into the mains as there is no
battery option. Also Sony have skimped on the packing as despite having a
mini USB connector no cable is included in the pack. Come on Sony, can't
you stretch to a simple cable?

Disappointingly the firmware seems to have few bugs. The menu system
gives you the option to rotate a photo but when you turn the frame off
the photo returns to its original orientation. This leaves that feature
feeling a bit pointless.

If you want a largish frame with a great screen then this Sony should
definitely be on your list of possibilities.
