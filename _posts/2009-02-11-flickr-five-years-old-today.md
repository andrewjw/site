Today is <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>'s <a href="http://code.flickr.com/blog/2009/02/10/birthday-kitten-tuesday/">fifth birthday</a>.
I've had a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/andrew_j_w">Flickr account</a> for several years, and I use the site all the time. For sharing photos,
finding photos to use on a website, or just to browse around it's really unmatched.

Happy Birthday Flickr!
