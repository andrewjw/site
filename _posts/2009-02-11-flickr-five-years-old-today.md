Today is [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com)'s [fifth birthday](http://code.flickr.com/blog/2009/02/10/birthday-kitten-tuesday/).
I've had a [Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/andrew_j_w) for several years, and I use the site all the time. For sharing photos,
finding photos to use on a website, or just to browse around it's really unmatched.

Happy Birthday Flickr!
