<p>For the past day and a half I have been building a website in Django rather than the C++ that is the bulk of my day job. It's so easy, it makes me sad that I have to go back to C++ this afternoon.</p>
<p>I've also discovered that aggregation, the main feature I want from django, aggregation, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/t/2167b4b877027317?hl=en">will be committed to trunk tomorrow</a>. Hurrah!</p>
