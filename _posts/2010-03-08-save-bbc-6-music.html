<p>I've been a regular listener to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music">6music</a> since about six months after it launched. Below is the email I've sent to the public consultation on the future of the station, as it has been proposed that the station be closed to save money which can be spent on making other programs.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I have been a regular listener to BBC 6 Music since about six months after it launched. Apart from the Today Program and a few comedy shows on Radio 4 it quickly became the only radio station I listened to. It provided the sound track to much of my University life and and introduced me to a wide range of new music that I would have never found otherwise. It has been tremendously influential and substantially shaped my taste in music.</p>
<p>I believe that closing 6 Music will prove to be a huge mistake and a massive step backwards for the BBC. If the BBC is to stand for excellence then closing a radio station that is staffed by people at the forefront of music seems to go against that. 6 Music's track record of finding a promoting new bands is something that BBC should be extremely proud of. </p>
<p>I believe that neither the BBC nor commercial stations offer a suitable replacement for 6 Music. Although 6 Music is associated with Radio 2 in style they are widely different. Although some assurances have been given that the best of 6 Music will be relocated to other stations I cannot see how this can be done during the peak listening hours without alienating the listeners of Radio 1 and 2. 6 Music is by it's very nature targets a niche audience, but its influence stretches far beyond its reach.</p>
<p>The fact that 6 Music is only available on DAB rather than FM radio is a key factor in its limited audience reach. It is probably the most well known of all the digital-only stations and key driver in transitioning people away from the antiquated analogue radio infrastructure. I own three digital radios which enable me to listen to 6 Music throughout my house. DAB certainly has its critics and loosing such a jewel in DAB radio's content reduces rather than increases the incentive to go digital.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that 6 Music is excellent value for money and I urge the BBC Trust to reject the recommendation to close it.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,<br />
Andrew Wilkinson

<p>Feel free to use my letter for inspiration, but please don't copy it wholesale. That will not help to save the station that we love. Find details on how to response <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/consultations/departments/bbc/bbc-strategy-review/consultation/consult_view">here</a>.</p>
