  Hi,


  This post is pretty old now, so maybe at that time, what I will say here was
  not correct, but as of now, as soon as you set a stemmed field up, and specify
  the right schema to the QueryParser, you do not need to set the termclass to
  whoosh.query.Variations. 


  In fact, if you use Variations of the user's query, you most likely wouldn't
  use stemming at indexing time. It's either using stemming at indexing-time,
  either using the morphological variations of the query at querying-time.


  The results are the same, just, using variations is more computing-power
  consuming at querying time since your python application needs to compare
  every querying term variation to the terms in the indexed field.


  In addition, in the case you want to use the Variations termclass of the terms
  in the user's query instead of stemming the fields while indexing, you would
  need to import the Variations class from whoosh.query before using it, like
  this: `from whoosh.query import Variations` ;)


  Anyway, thanks for this post, it helped me a lot while investigating in the
  good direction now that I'm discovering Whoosh.


  Cheers
