message: "Hi Victor,\r\n\r\nI'm afraid that there isn't much I can do about PyQt not being available in PyPI. It's pretty easy to install in globally though, and you can set virtualenv to fall back to global packages. Is that not acceptable?\r\n\r\nI use virtualenv with my sites, but I'm not sure that putting your IDE in there makes sense.The IDE isn't required to run the site...\r\n\r\nAndrew"
