  All your arguments make sense, and I do keep my lines as short as possible.
  What I don't do is keep to a hard limit of 80 columns. Sometimes I think it's
  clearer to have a function call on one line, even though it might be 85 or 90
  characters long. If you're hitting 80 columns because of nested ifs or for
  loops then your code definitely needs to be refactored.


  I think it's important to only get PyLint to alert to the more serious
  problems with the code, otherwise you'll be overwhelmed with changes that need
  to be made.
