message: "Hi Andrew,\r\n\r\nI'm really enjoying this topic, I think you are witting about a lot of interesting things all together. I'm trying to follow your posts, but I've found a problem in this part that I didn't manage to solve due to the lack of information about CouchDB on Celery. When I launch celery:\r\n\r\npython rdc_crawler/manage.py celeryd -l info\r\n\r\nIt fails, raising unauthorized error, you can see traceback at http://paste.org/pastebin/view/39372. As far as I know the problem comes to Celery not sending authorization credentials to CouchDB:\r\n\r\nPUT /couchdb%2Fcelery HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: my.host.com\r\nContent-Length:0\r\nAccept: application/json                                                                                                       \r\nUser-Agent: CouchDB-Python/0.8 \r\n\r\nMy settings are:\r\nBROKER_TRANSPORT = \"couchdb\"\r\nBROKER_HOST = \"my.host.com\"\r\nBROKER_PORT = 80\r\nBROKER_USER = \"user\"\r\nBROKER_PASSWORD = \"pass\"\r\nBROKER_VHOST = \"couchdb/celery\"\r\nBROKER_USER_SSL = True\r\n\r\nAny hint about how to properly set credentials?\r\n\r\nPS: I'm running CouchDB under nginx proxy at my.host.com:80/couchdb and CouchDB with require_valid_user = true option"
