message: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for your answer, but don worry I've got it working. Kombu (celery amqp framework) has a bug, so credentials wasn't used. I've fixed it and sent a pull request on GitHub, so this will be fixed on new Kombu versions, in the meantime I'm using my own patched version.\r\n\r\nBye"
