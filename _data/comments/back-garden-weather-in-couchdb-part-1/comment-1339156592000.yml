  Hi John,


  Glad you like the site. You're right, there is a lot of interest in weather
  sites in the Welwyn area!


  Unfortunately my site is available all the time, it's just that I don't want
  to have a computer on 24/7 to talk to the weather station. At the moment it
  only updates when I'm recording tv. This is usual around 2pm and most evenings
  after 7pm.


  I use the site to check how much ran we've had and how cold it was last night
  so I don't need it to be up to date all the time.


  Andrew
