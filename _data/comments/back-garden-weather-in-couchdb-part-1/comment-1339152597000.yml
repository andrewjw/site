  Hello, thanks, useful site - I live in hertford and have found about 10!
  weather stations around within 10 miles or so, eg in Stevenage, Epping,
  Harlow, Sawbrideworth, Puckerdege and of course Welwyn, tho' none in Hertford
  or Hoddesdon yet. 


  Pity yours is not on all the time. Have you thought about hosting it on a
  'free' web site?  


  If one googles welwyn weather station there seems to be another site there,
  hosted by virgin. Unfortunately there is no contact info eg email for it so I
  can't let them know if it goes awol. Given fact that Welwyn is small place,
  must be most weather stations/sq km anywhere, outside big cities! 


  John
