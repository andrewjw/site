  What Github needs to do is make the default fork behavior be to inherit the
  Issue Tracker, and Wiki, the Issue Tracker can create a automatic label
  identifying the fork. Then if the forking user wishes to they can create an
  independent Issue Tracker or Wiki, as some Fork may be the root of a new
  project or become that latter.
