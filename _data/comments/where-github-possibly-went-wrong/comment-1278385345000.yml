message: "I don't see anything wrong on this, actually, I much more prefer this viral approach.\r\n\r\nI've been around open source since the SourceForge days, and what I can see with GitHub now is that it enables for, at least, a lot more experimentation.\r\n\r\nWith SourceForge you usually had a crappy project website, close to no documentation, no easy issue tracker, and some hidden indication on how to acquire the latest trunk. Even if the project looked interesting and they actually *had* code, you were just turned down to spend more than 1 minute there.\r\n\r\nWith GitHub, you have so many things easy accessible (wiki, issues, repository history), and is so easy to fork and pull a branch, that you actually feel motivated to at least experiment. Then maybe you liked, spent some time on your fork and pushed a change or two. The original author can get see your changes and merge right away if he likes.\r\n\r\nNo blabbering on the project mailing list. No having to put a ticket up, no having to deal with \"please attach a better diff if you wanna see your code merged\". It's right to what matters: the code the person wrote, instead of \"opensource bureaucracy\" like most nerds like to do - specially when the project is more popular.\r\n\r\nI can't say it went wrong anywhere regarding this. In fact, I think it was right on the nail."
