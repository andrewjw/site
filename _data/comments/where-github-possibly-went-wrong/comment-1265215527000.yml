message: "Chris Wansstrath from Github actually directly addressed this issue in a podcast I listened to: http://thechangelog.com/post/352878673/episode-0-1-0-chris-wanstrath-from-github\r\n\r\nThey recognize that not being able to determine where the \"real\" master branch is can become a problem. The good news is that they're convinced there's a good technical solution to help make the social solution easier. By looking just at unique commits, he said (and I'm paraphrasing and misquoting of course) that for a vast majority of projects there is actually a clear \"main\" branch of development where most changes get pulled in. Identifying that branch prominently is something they're working on.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with making developers \"rock stars\" as long as that doesn't impact usability for non-developers. In fact, I'd argue that making things project-centric is the *problem* not the solution. I know I'm much, much more likely to contribute minor changes back to a project if it's on github just because it's so easy to do and because I don't have to ask any permission.\r\n\r\nIt'll be exciting to see if they can address the \"which fork do I use\" problem."
