  To compound the forking problem at GitHub... some idiots who are new to the
  site, yours truly included, decide to click the "Fork" button just to see what
  it does, and without as much as an "Are you sure?", and boom! a brand new
  forked project gets created. I found out how to delete mine, but I'm not sure
  how many others would bother.
