  Using the -a flag will cause comparison with timestamps of the files at Source
  and Destination - since S3FS does not support timestamp modification on the S3
  bucket - this will cause rsync to find all the files to be different and it
  will always recopy all the files every time. The solution is to use
  --size-only and -r instead of -a.

  rsync -v -r --size-only /path/to/sourcefolder/ /path/to/destfolder/ 

  (-v is for verbose output, -r is for recursive directory copying, --size-only
  only uses file-size to determine if files are different or not).


  You can verify the difference yourself by doing a rsync dry-run with -n flag
  (rsync test mode which only lists which files are going to be synced, but does
  not actually copy any files):

  rsync -n -v -r --size-only /path/to/sourcefolder/ /path/to/destfolder/
