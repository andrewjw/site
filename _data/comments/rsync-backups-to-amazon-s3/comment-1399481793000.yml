  Was wanting to try this, including the trickle part, on an amazon beanstalk
  instance but trickle isn't there and "sudo yum install trickle" fails. 
  Downloaded the trickle source but the configure step fails not finding
  libevent, yet "sudo yum install libevent" says libevent is already installed. 
  Any tips on how I'd install trickle on amazon linux?
