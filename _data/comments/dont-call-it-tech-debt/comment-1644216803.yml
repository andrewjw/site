  I resist the phrase "tech debt" because I think the analogy is not a good one -- financially, debts can be rolled over, they can be cancelled, and money is fungible -- this amount of debt here is the same as that amount of debt over there.

I try and talk about "maintenance". If you don't do "maintenance" on your car, eventually it will explode / die / fail in a variety of minor and catastrophic ways. That seems to me to hew closer to the truth of how software systems operate.
