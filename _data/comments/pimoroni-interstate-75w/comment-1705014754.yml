  Hi Andrew!
  
  let's consider using a simulated water sensor using a Raspberry Pi and a flow sensor. Note that the specifics can vary based on the actual hardware you have. In this example, we'll use the `RPi.GPIO` library for GPIO access on a Raspberry Pi. If you're using a different platform or sensor, adapt accordingly.
  
  First, install the required library:
  
  ```bash
  pip install RPi.GPIO
  ```
  
  Now, a simple example using a hypothetical flow sensor:
  
  ```python
  import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
  import time
  
  class WaterSensor:
      def __init__(self, pin):
          self.pin = pin
          GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
          GPIO.setup(self.pin, GPIO.IN)
  
      def get_water_usage(self):
          try:
              pulse_count = 0
              last_state = GPIO.input(self.pin)
              
              while True:
                  current_state = GPIO.input(self.pin)
                  
                  if current_state != last_state:
                      pulse_count += 1
  
                  last_state = current_state
                  time.sleep(0.1)  # Adjust sleep time based on your sensor's characteristics
  
          except KeyboardInterrupt:
              # Cleanup GPIO on keyboard interrupt
              GPIO.cleanup()
  
  # Assuming the flow sensor is connected to GPIO pin 17
  sensor = WaterSensor(pin=17)
  
  try:
      # Fetch water usage from the sensor
      water_usage = sensor.get_water_usage()
  
      # For demonstration purposes, print the water usage every 5 seconds
      while True:
          print(f"Water Usage: {water_usage} pulses")
          time.sleep(5)
  
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
      print("\n  Exiting...")
  finally:
      GPIO.cleanup()
  ```
  
  Note that this is a simplified example, and the actual implementation might vary based on your specific flow sensor and hardware setup. Make sure to consult your sensor's datasheet and wiring diagrams for accurate integration.
