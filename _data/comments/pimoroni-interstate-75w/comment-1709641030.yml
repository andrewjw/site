  We've just had a smart meter installed by Anglian water.. the closest I've got is a bit of web scraping - https://community.home-assistant.io/t/integrating-anglia-water-usage-for-smart-meters-uk/596671/99 - although I've not actually bothered with it yet... I should really, though, because otherwise it's just flushing money down the toilet!
