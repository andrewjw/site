message: "Becoming second nature is the key and it has to start with the very beginning of a project.  I've found it almost impossible to \"add\" this kind of process into an existing development project, but you'll often get buy-in for new projects.\r\n\r\nAnother key is to pick tools that help rather than hinder you with this.  You're right on the money about integration between the tools being of utmost importance.  None of the benefits of forcing yourself to work this way will last long if the tools being used make it harder to work this way.\r\n\r\nIf the tools help you with this flow, though, then you've got a chance to keep the momentum going and follow through."
