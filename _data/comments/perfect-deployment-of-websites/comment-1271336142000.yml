message: "I agree with Joel on this point - a single line deployment process definitely indicates that an appropriate amount of time has been spent on tools and processes, rather than just getting the code written.\r\n\r\nFor a website written in a scripting language a single line deployment process shouldn't be too hard. If something requires building or packaging then it's harder, but still far from impossible."
