  You're completely right, but I think that if I were serious about "beating
  Google" then even SOLR wouldn't cut it! SOLR's a great piece of tech, but it's
  not as simple as Whoosh to get up and running. For a few shortish blog posts I
  didn't want to have to spend ages describing how to configure SOLR, with
  Whoosh it's a few lines of code and you're away. Whoosh also has the advantage
  of being pure-Python, so it fits with Django and Celery.
