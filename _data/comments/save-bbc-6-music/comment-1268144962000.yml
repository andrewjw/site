message: "All well put andrew. Better and more polite than what i wrote. \r\nPolicy of quality over quantity makes sense in theory but 6 music is quality, cutting it makes no sense. Its relatively cheap per listener distincive quality. Maybe the Bbc bosses should be focused on growing 6 and adding bit of quality to radio one and two ( cut budget of one and two and let them share some of 6 's content ?  I know it would only work on real off peak slots but slight saving on one or two's budget would pay for six. )"
