message: "Actively offering away their teen services to commercial competition, and slashing the digital and online output seems like savage self-harm. It is also clearly 6 Music that has caused the most discontent.\r\n\r\nThese plans come under the fallacious policy of “quality over quantity”. Cutting one of the smallest yet most distinctive radio stations produced by the Beeb is perhaps not the ideal starting-point.\r\n\r\nIf you have some spare time then please read my blog on the reaction to the proposed axe of 6 Music at http://bit.ly/9qrwke, a www.fatsoma.com blog."
