  Hi,


  I don't think storing the md5 of the url will be much help. If the url is
  different then the md5 would be different too. In my code if a url issues a
  301/302 redirect then you'll get one document under the url which redirects
  and one for the url it redirects to. I think the best solution is to check
  what url the page was actually loaded from and only store the document under
  that.


  Hope that helps,

  Andrew
