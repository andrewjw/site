  Thanks for the comment Kristian.


  I think the title is more hyperbole than arrogance! You need a hook to get
  people reading :-)


  You're right, Whoosh is not as fully featured as Solr and of course even Solr
  would not be enough to scale up to petabytes of data. The big advantage that
  Whoosh gives you is that it is very easy to set up. Just a few lines of code
  and you've got a full text search engine. No messing around with daemons or
  xml configuration files. For a series of short blog posts that was the
  deciding factor.


  I use both Solr and Whoosh at work, depending on the context. I think they
  both have their place.
