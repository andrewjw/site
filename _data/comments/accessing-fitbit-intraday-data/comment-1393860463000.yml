  Andrew, thank you for this great post. I was successfully capturing intraday
  data, however, when I went to run the script today, I received an invalid
  username or password error. I haven't changed my credentials or the process by
  which I run the script. I was wondering if you had any thoughts on this. Any
  guidance would be greatly appreciated.


  Thanks,

  Jonathan
