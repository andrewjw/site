  Hi Andrew,


  thanks for your great script to get the fitbit data.


  Additionaly i want to use the dump2sqlite.py script. But i have problems in
  indentifying the proper credentials from the cockies (Firefox 27.0 both on Win
  and OSX 10.9.1). It would be very helpful to get assistance for gaining the
  information.


  Thanks.
