  I am giving up now, but at least I learned a fair amount about Python and its
  programming community. Anyone who wishes to use Andrew's module and comes from
  an inexperienced position like me might experiment with the latest version of
  Python 2 instead of Python 3. If you decide to go with Python 3 like I did
  (latest final version is the greatest?), this site can help with installing
  modules that may be necessary to use Andrew's module: . Also, errors
  encountered on commas appear to be fixed in Python 3 by replacing the comma
  with an open parenthesis and then closing it appropriately. I hope this saves
  someone the few hours I spent bumbling around.
