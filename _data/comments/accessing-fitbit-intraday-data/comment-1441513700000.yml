message: "Andrew, I found your script the other day and was finally able to download my data today. Thanks for providing the dump.py script. I am mostly interested in seeing my sleep data, but I'm sure I'll make use of the rest of it too.\r\n\r\nYou indicated that you have a Fitbit One (or had). Did you figure out how to download the information for floors? I'm curious what the values for that are, or how I would find that intraday information. \r\n\r\nThank you (and wadey),\r\n\r\nInez"
