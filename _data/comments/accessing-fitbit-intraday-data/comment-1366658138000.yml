  I had the Problem that running it as described above yielded the following
  error: 


  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "examples/dump.py", line 14, in 
      import fitbit
  ImportError: No module named fitbit


  I moved the dump.py from the example folder to the parent folder, so it lies
  beside the fitbit folder.

  I now run: python dump.py   


  works. Python is 2.7 on OS X (from macports)
