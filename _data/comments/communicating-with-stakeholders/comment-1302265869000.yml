message: "The transition has gone very well, although it has mostly be an underground movement where the developers are deciding to use rather than it being imposed by management. There is some confusion because not everyone is using FogBugz and are still using Bugzilla.\r\n\r\nI hadn't heard about OnTime, but it looks interesting. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback,\r\nAndrew"
